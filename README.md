## Project - Push_swap ðŸ“‰:

:white_check_mark: **125/125**

:green_circle: **Mandatory part**

The Push swap project is a very simple and a highly straightforward algorithm project of sorting data.\
You have at your disposal a set of integer values, 2 stacks, and a set of instructions to manipulate both stacks.\
The program calculates and displays instructions on the standard output, that sorts the integers received as arguments.

:eight_spoked_asterisk: **V.1 The rules**
- You have 2 stacks named a and b.
- At the beginning:
  - The stack a contains a random amount of negative and/or positive numbers
which cannot be duplicated.
  - The stack b is empty.
- The goal is to sort in ascending order numbers into stack a. To do so you have the
following operations at your disposal:
  * **sa** (swap a): Swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack a.\
    Do nothing if there is only one or no elements.
  * **sb** (swap b): Swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack b.\
    Do nothing if there is only one or no elements.
  * **ss** : sa and sb at the same time.
  * **pa** (push a): Take the first element at the top of b and put it at the top of a.\
    Do nothing if b is empty.
  * **pb** (push b): Take the first element at the top of a and put it at the top of b.\
    Do nothing if a is empty.
  * **ra** (rotate a): Shift up all elements of stack a by 1.\
    The first element becomes the last one.
  * **rb** (rotate b): Shift up all elements of stack b by 1.\
    The first element becomes the last one.
  * **rr** : ra and rb at the same time.
  * **rra** (reverse rotate a): Shift down all elements of stack a by 1.\
    The last element becomes the first one.
  * **rrb** (reverse rotate b): Shift down all elements of stack b by 1.\
    The last element becomes the first one.
  * **rrr** : rra and rrb at the same time.

:eight_spoked_asterisk: **V.2 Example**

To illustrate the effect of some of these instructions, letâ€™s sort a random list of integers.
In this example, weâ€™ll consider that both stacks grow from the right.

:eight_spoked_asterisk: **V.3 The "push_swap" program**

**Program name**  - push_swap\
**Turn in files** - Makefile, *.h, *.c\
**Makefile**      - NAME, all, clean, fclean, re\
**Arguments**     - stack a: A list of integers\
**External functs.** - read, write, malloc, free, exit, ft_printf and any equivalent YOU coded\
**Libft authorized** - Yes\
**Description**   - Sort stacks

Your project must comply with the following rules:
- You have to turn in a Makefile which will compile your source files. It must not
relink.
- Global variables are forbidden.
- You have to write a program named push_swap that takes as an argument the stack
a formatted as a list of integers. The first argument should be at the top of the
stack (be careful about the order).
- The program must display the smallest list of instructions possible to sort the stack
a, the smallest number being at the top.
- Instructions must be separated by a â€™\nâ€™ and nothing else.
- The goal is to sort the stack with the lowest possible number of operations. During
the evaluation process, the number of instructions found by your program will be
compared against a limit: the maximum number of operations tolerated. If your
program either displays a longer list or if the numbers arenâ€™t sorted properly, your
grade will be 0.
- If no parameters are specified, the program must not display anything and give the
prompt back.
- In case of error, it must display "Error" followed by a â€™\nâ€™ on the standard error.
Errors include for example: some arguments arenâ€™t integers, some arguments are
bigger than an integer and/or there are duplicates.

:eight_spoked_asterisk: **V.4 Benchmark**

To validate this project, you must perform certain sorts with a minimal number of operations:
- For a **minimalist validation** (that implies a minimal grade of 80)), you must be
able to **sort 100 random numbers in fewer than 700 operations**.
- For **maximal project validation** and thus to be able to achieve the bonuses, you
must fulfill the first step above, but also for **500 random numbers**, there should
be **no more than 5500 operations**.

:yellow_circle: **Bonus part**

Checker program checks if the given instructions sorts the stack.

**Program name**  - checker\
**Turn in files** - *.h, *.c\
**Makefile**      - bonus\
**Arguments**     - stack a: A list of integers\
**External functs.** - read, write, malloc, free, exit, ft_printf and any equivalent YOU coded\
**Libft authorized** - Yes\
**Description**   - Execute the sorting instructions

:eight_pointed_black_star: Rules:
- Write a program named checker that takes as an argument the stack a formatted
as a list of integers. The first argument should be at the top of the stack (be careful
about the order). If no argument is given, it stops and displays nothing.
- It will then wait and read instructions on the standard input, each instruction will
be followed by â€™\nâ€™. Once all the instructions have been read, the program has to
execute them on the stack received as an argument.
- If after executing those instructions, the stack a is actually sorted and the stack b
is empty, then the program must display "OK" followed by a â€™\nâ€™ on the standard
output.
- In every other case, it must display "KO" followed by a â€™\nâ€™ on the standard output.
- In case of error, you must display "Error" followed by a â€™\nâ€™ on the standard error. Errors include for example: some arguments are not integers, some arguments
are bigger than an integer, there are duplicates, an instruction doesnâ€™t exist and/or
is incorrectly formatted.
